{% cut "What should I add to a batch?" %}

Batches are datasets that need to be labeled. Add to batches TSV files with IDs and links to media files.

Example of filling in a TSV file:

```
id  image_url
1   https://yastat.net/s3/tb/static/file-examples/special/street.jpg
```

{% endcut %}

{% cut "My project is being moderated. Can I add task items to it?" %}
