# Generating and editing prompt

> We split provided dataset into two parts:
>
> - Measure quality — labeled by a model for quality measurement
> - Prompt examples — items we will use as few shots to show a model what we need it to do.
>
> Providing few-shot examples significantly improves the quality but at the same time to get a representative measurement we don't include examples into a dataset we measure quality on.
