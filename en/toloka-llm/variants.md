# Getting variants

#### Evaluating model performance

> Changing prompt invalidates quality measurement for a variant being edited. Changing dataset invalidates quality measurement for all variants.

## Running tests and getting variants {#get-variants}

> Finding the optimal variant (with good enough quality and low enough price) is the main goal of the tool. We show all created variants in one column. You can choose a metric to compare them with each other. For a metric to be displayed you need to have a labeled dataset and run a model.
>
> Variant automatically appears after user has added classes
>
> When there is only 1 variant it can't be deleted
>
> User can clone / duplicate variant
>
> Parameters + prompt = variant
>
> You can select the best variant based on its accuracy to price ratio.
