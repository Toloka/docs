# Registering and signing in

You must register or sign in to {{ llm-name }} before you can start use it.

{{ llm-name }} has two versions: dataset labeling and demonstration mode. You can choose one of them when [registering or signing in](#registering):

- **Dataset labeling**

    This is your usual workspace in {{ llm-name }}. Here you create projects, specify classes, upload tasks, and get results.

- **Demonstration mode**

    This is a place to get acquainted with {{ llm-name }}. It can be useful if you don't know anything about labeling with the help of LLM and want to see how it works.

Both versions look similar and the only difference is that the demonstration mode contains prepared sample datasets and predefined classes and labels.

The registration and sign-in processes are also similar for both versions.
