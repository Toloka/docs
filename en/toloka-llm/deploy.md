# Deploying project

You can deploy the project right after you create it and generate variants.

{% note info %}

We provide you with a free $5 credit, so you can try the service and play with it. Once you use it, you either need to provide us with an [OpenAI API key](funds.md#openai-key) or [top up your balance](funds.md#bank-card).

{% endnote %}

When you have a variant with the accuracy to price ratio that fits your purpose, deploy the project and use it with real datasets.

For that, click **![Deploy](_images/deploy.svg) Deploy** on the [variant card](variants.md).

- If you have enough funds on your account, you will be redirected to the variant page where you can test the model on [real data](#real-data) and [download the results](results.md).

- If haven't added OpenAI API key or don't have a bank card attached to your account, you will [have to do this](funds.md).

The currently deployed variant will be available at the **Deployment** page.

## Uploading real data to label {#real-data}

Now you can upload real data and label it.

1. Click **![Upload dataset](_images/upload-dataset.svg) Upload dataset**.

1. Choose the dataset with the data you want to label.

1. When the dataset is uploaded, click **![Start labeling](_images/start-labeling.svg) Start labeling**

The labeling will take some time. When it's finished, you can [view the labeling statistics](results.md#statistics) and [download the results](results.md#get-results).
