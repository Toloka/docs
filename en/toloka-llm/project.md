# Starting project

When you register in {{ llm-name }}, the platform creates the first project automatically. You will see the project interface when you sign in.

To start working with it,

- [upload a dataset](dataset.md),
- [describe your task](task-description.md),
- [add classes](classes.md) and their descriptions,
- [label several items](classes.md#label-classes) for the model to better understand the task,
- [generate a prompt](prompt.md),
- run tests and [get variants](variants.md).

{% note info %}

Most of the steps above are optional, but we recommend that you don't skip them for better results.

{% endnote %}

After that you can [deploy the resulting model](deploy.md) to try it on a real dataset and [get results](results.md) of the labeling.
