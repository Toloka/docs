# {{ llm-name }}

{{ llm-name }} is a platform designed to simplify data-labeling with large-language models (LLMs) and provide you tools to get the high quality labeling results for your business case.

Currently, {{ llm-name }} allows you to complete text classification tasks using LLMs.

Compared to [self-service projects](../guide/concepts/project.md) which [Tolokers](../glossary.md#toloker) complete, {{ llm-name }} doesn't engage [crowdsourcing](../glossary.md#crowdsourcing) for text classification projects.

## Why choose {{ llm-name }}?

{{ llm-name }} offers the following advantages for you to easily start labeling texts with LLMs:

- Structured input: We bring structure to your interactions with LLM so your labeling task is solved in a predictable and robust way.
- Strong defaults: We provide you with a prompt and a model which are a great starting point for your experiments with the model or could be used right away.
- Flexibility: We aim to give you maximum control over the end result, so there is no hidden prompts. What you see is what is sent to the model.
- Quality evaluation: With labeled datasets enabling quality measurement you can experiment with LLM in a efficient non-guessing way.
- Easy deploy: You can use API to get labeled results or do bulk-labeling with file upload.
