## Parameters Description

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| :----------| :----| :-----------|
`issue_task_suites_in_creation_order`|**Optional\[bool\]**|<p>For pools that don&#x27;t use “smart mixing”. Assign task suites in the order in which they were uploaded. For example, for a pool with an overlap of 5, the first task suite is assigned to five Tolokers, then the second task suite, and so on.
