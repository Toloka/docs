# Getting API key

Before you start using Toloka-Kit library, register in either the production or sandbox Toloka web version, get your key for the API access, and top up your account.

## Registration

    - The [production](https://platform.toloka.ai/for-requesters/) version is used by default in [this example](recipes/learn-basics.md).
