Yandex Disk integration is no longer supported by Toloka and is only available to those who connected it earlier.

To upload images, we recommend that you use [wampi]({{ wampi }}), [imgbb]({{ imgbb }}), [ImageShack]({{ imageshack }}), or [imgur]({{ imgur }}) photo hosting services. This way you can quickly get direct links to your images to add them to the task file or instructions.
