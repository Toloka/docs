# Change pool priority

{% include [announce](../_includes/announce.md) %}

Changes the priority of a pool.

If you have multiple pools and want Tolokers to be offered one pool before another, change the pool priority. You don't need to stop the pool for that, it must have the "open" or "closed" status.

Priority is a number on a scale from 0 to 100. The larger the number, the faster the pool will be labeled compared to your other pools.
