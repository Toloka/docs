# Edit a task

{% include [announce](../_includes/announce.md) %}

Changes the task overlap.

You can:

- Set a [numeric value](create-task.md#overlap) or an [infinite overlap](create-task.md#infinite) to assign a task to all Tolokers (for example, for training tasks).

- Add preliminary responses or change [their values](create-task.md#baseline) if they were set.

    Preliminary responses are used to calculate  response confidence when dynamic overlap (incremental relabeling, IRL) is enabled.

- Make [control](../../glossary.md#control-task) and [training](../../glossary.md#training-task) tasks from regular ones or edit [responses](create-task.md#known) and [hints](create-task.md#message) for existing tasks.
