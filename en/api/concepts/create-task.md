## Headers {#headers}

#|
|| Title | Overview ||
|| **Authorization** | A token for account authorization. Add OAuth as a prefix. ||
|| **Content-Type** | Specifies the data format in the request body. ||
|#

## Query parameters {#query-params}

Specified in the link after the question mark; separated by `&`.

#|
|| Parameter | Overview ||
|| **async_mode** {#async_mode} | **boolean**

Mode for request processing:

- `true` — Asynchronous. Creates an asynchronous operation that runs in the background. The response contains information about the operation (start and completion time, status, number of task suites).
- `false` — Synchronous. The response contains information about one or more created tasks. Maximum of 5000 tasks per request.

The default value is `false`. ||
|| **allow_defaults** | **boolean**

Overlap settings:

- `true` — Use the overlap that is set in the pool parameters (in the [defaults.default_overlap_for_new_tasks](create-pool.md#default-overlap-tasks) key).
- `false` — Use the overlap that is set in the task parameters (in the [overlap](#overlap) field).

The default value is `false`. ||
|| **skip_invalid_items** | **boolean**

Validation parameters for JSON objects:

- `true` — Create the tasks that passed validation. Skip the rest of the tasks (errors will be listed in the response to the request).
- `false` — If one or more tasks didn't pass validation, stop the operation and don't create any tasks.

The default value is `false`. ||
|| **open_pool** | **boolean**

Open the pool immediately after the operation is completed, if the pool is closed. The default value is `false`. ||
|| **operation_id** | **string**

Operation ID for a scheduled upload of one or more tasks (if `async_mode=true` is set).

We recommended sending the ID in the POST request to avoid accidental errors, such as creating the operation multiple times for the same tasks.

The ID should conform to the [RFC4122 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122).

You can use this ID in the future to [get information about the operation](operations.md). ||

#|
|| Key | Overview ||
|| **pool_id** | **string \| required**

ID of the pool that the task is uploaded to. ||
|| **input_values** | **object \| required**

Input data for a task. List of pairs:

```json
  "<ID of field 1>": "<value of field 1>",
  "<ID of field 2>": "<value of field 2>",
  ...
  "<ID of field N>": "<value of field N>"
```
||
|| **known_solutions[].output_values** | **object \| required**

Output data values to check. You should specify values for all required output data fields.

```json
  "<ID of field 1>": "<correct response>",
  "<ID of field 2>": "<correct response>",
  ...
```
||
|| **baseline_solutions[].output_values** | **object \| required**

Output data values for preliminary responses.

```json
  "<ID of field 1>": "<preliminary response>",
  "<ID of field 2>": "<preliminary response>",
  ...
```
||
|| **baseline_solutions[].confidence_weight** | **float \| required**

Confidence in a response, from 0 to 1.

The default value is 1. ||
|| **overlap** {#overlap} | **string \| required if**

Required if the `allow_defaults=true` parameter is not used when creating tasks and the overlap is not specified in the pool parameters (the [defaults.default_overlap_for_new_tasks](create-pool.md#default-overlap-tasks) key).

Task overlap. ||
|| **known_solutions[]** {#known} | **array of objects**

Correct responses to [control](../../glossary.md#control-task) and [training](../../glossary.md#training-task) tasks.

You can specify several options for a correct task response.

If one option is more correct than another, you can assign different weights to the response options. To do this, use the `correctness_weight` key. ||
|| **known_solutions[].correctness_weight** | **float**

The weight of a correct response in the range from 0 to 1.

Lets you count a response as partially correct. This is convenient when there is no single right response to the task.

This works like awarding points: if you need to complete one control task correctly to get a skill (receive 1 point), you may complete one task with a weight of 1 or two tasks with a weight of 0.5 or higher.

The default value is 1. ||
|| **baseline_solutions[]** {#baseline} | **array of objects**

Preliminary responses. This data simulates Toloker responses when calculating `confidence` in a response. It is used in dynamic overlap (also known as incremental relabeling or IRL) and aggregation of results by skill.

Define `output_values` and `confidence_weight` for each preliminary response.

For example, you ask Tolokers to label whether an image shows a cat or a dog. Suppose your neural network already determined that the image might show a dog with a probability of 80% and a cat with a probability of 40%. Let's say you set dynamic overlap from 1 to 3 and the minimum response confidence at 85%.

If the Toloker answers "Dog" and the confidence in their response is high, the overlap most likely won't increase because one response is enough. If the Toloker answers "Cat", the confidence is most likely not high enough and the overlap will increase further.

Can't be used when creating a task suite: an error with code 400 saying `VALUE_NOT_ALLOWED` will be returned to your request. ||
|| **message_on_unknown_solution** {#message} | **string**

Hint for the task (for training tasks). ||
|| **infinite_overlap** {#infinite} | **boolean**

Assigns tasks with infinite overlap. For instance, you can use this for training tasks when you want to assign them to all Tolokers:

- `true` — Use infinite overlap.
- `false` — Use the overlap that is set for the task or pool.

The default value is `false`. ||
|| **origin_task_id** | **string**

ID of the task it was copied from. ||
|| **reserved_for[]** | **array of strings**

IDs of Tolokers who will have access to the task. ||
|| **unavailable_for[]** | **array of strings**

IDs of Tolokers who shouldn't have access to the task. ||
