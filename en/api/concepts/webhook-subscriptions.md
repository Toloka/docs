# Overview

You can create a subscription and receive notifications from Toloka when certain events occur, for example:

- When a pool closes.
- When a task's status changes to a specified one.
- When an aggregated score appears after dynamic overlap.

The events that you want to be notified about are set when [creating a subscription](put-webhook-subscriptions.md).

Notifications about the events you're subscribed to are sent in JSON format. For a description ofÂ notification data, see [Notification format](using-webhook-subscriptions.md).
