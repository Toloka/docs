If you want to collect personal information, make sure your task contains consent to personal data processing. This includes:

  - The terms of the Privacy Notice.

  - The purpose of personal data processing (how the data will be used in general and for scientific/research purposes specifically).

  - Company name and legal address of the researcher.

  - How to withdraw consent (for example, by sending an email request).

To learn how to select a data processing purpose for your project, see these [instructions](../../../../guide/concepts/personal-data-processing.md).

If your tasks contain personal information, then pseudonymize, anonymize or remove it before transmitting to Toloka. For example, you can cover up people's faces in photos, cut out the document fields that are filled, and change the pitch of the voice in speech recordings.
