Specify the pool type in the **Pool type** drop-down list:

- **General tasks**: The main pool that contains your regular tasks.

- **Exam**: A pool that contains only [control tasks](../../glossary.md#control-task).

- **Training**: A main pool that consists only of [training tasks](../../glossary.md#training-task) and can have zero cost. Use it to train Tolokers before performing real tasks if the [training pool](train.md) doesn't work well for your project.

- **Retry**: A pool that helps Tolokers who make mistakes improve their skills and get a second chance to complete tasks.

- **Other**: If none of the previous options fit.
