## Project moderation {#moderation}

{% note warning %}

Before launching the project, see the [What tasks can't be placed in Toloka?](../../../../guide/concepts/unwanted.md) page.

{% endnote %}

Moderation begins when you launch the first pool of a new project in which the pools have not been started before. 

This usually takes about 1 hour. In some cases, the moderation process may take longer.

Note that tasks are not available to Tolokers during moderation.

If moderation was successful and you didn't pause the pool, then the project will be launched and Tolokers will be able to take your task.

Otherwise, you'll see the **Your project didn't pass moderation** label under the project name and get the appropriate notification. In this case, you won't be able to launch pools and Tolokers won't see tasks from the project.

If the [rules](../../../../guide/concepts/unwanted.md) have been violated and your project is rejected:

1. Press the **Contact support** button on the pool page or on the project page to find out why the project was rejected.

2. Follow the recommendations of our support and [edit](../../../../guide/concepts/edit-project.md) the project to eliminate violations.

    Also you can [clone](../../../../guide/concepts/project.md#clone) the project, make changes in it and launch the cloned project to start moderation again.

3. Ask the support to recheck and accept project.
