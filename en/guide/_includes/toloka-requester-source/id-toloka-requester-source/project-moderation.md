## Project moderation {#moderation}

{% note warning %}

Before launching the project, see the [What tasks can't be placed in Toloka?](../../../../guide/concepts/unwanted.md) page.

{% endnote %}

When you launch first pool of a new project, it is sent to moderation. 

This usually takes about 1 hour. Doubtful cases and projects involving sensitive topics may take longer to pass moderation.

If moderation was successful and you didn't pause the pool, then the project will be launched and Tolokers will be able to take your task.

Otherwise, you'll see the **Your project didn't pass moderation** under the project name and get the appropriate notification. In this case, you won't be able to launch pools and Tolokers won't see tasks from the project.

If the [rules](../../../../guide/concepts/unwanted.md) have been violated and your project is rejected:

1. Press the **Contact support** button on the pool page or on the project page to find out why the project was rejected.

2. [Edit](../../../../guide/concepts/edit-project.md) the project according to the rules.

3. Ask the support to recheck and accept project.

{% note info %}

Tasks are not available to Tolokers during moderation.
