## Project moderation {#moderation}

After you press **Start labeling**, your project is sent to moderation. You can see the moderation status under the project name on the pool page or on the project page.

Statuses:

* **Pending** — **Start pool** button and edit mode are inactive, preview mode is active.
* **Rejected** — Toloka support notifies you that your project didn't pass and that you need to change it. If you didn't get any notification, press **Contact support**.
* **Ready for labeling** — your project has been approved, edit mode is avialable again.

You cannot add:

* political surveys;
* tasks that transmit personal data of Tolokers or third parties;
* field tasks or data markup from the places where figiting is taking place.

See the complete list of data you cannot add on the [What tasks can't be placed in Toloka?](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/unwanted) page.
