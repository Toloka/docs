## Project moderation {#moderation}

After you press the **Start labeling** button on the pool page, your project is sent to moderation. You can see the moderation status under the project name on the pool page or on the project page.

Moderation statuses:

* **Pending** — the **Start labeling** button and edit mode are inactive, preview mode is active.
* **Rejected** — Toloka support notifies you that your project didn't pass and that you need to change it. If you didn't get any notifications, press the **Contact support** button on the pool page or on the project page.
* **Ready for labeling** — your project has been approved, the **Start labeling** button and edit mode are avialable again.

You cannot launch:

* political surveys;
* tasks that transmit personal data of Tolokers or third parties;
* field tasks or data labeling from the places where fighting is taking place.

To see the complete list of tasks that you can't launch, go to the [What tasks can't be placed in Toloka?](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/unwanted) page.
