It depends on the task. Technically, you can use as many tasks you want.

But users are reluctant to take lengthy tasks. They'd rather do 10 tasks that take one minute each than one task that takes 10 minutes.

In addition, if you use a large number of tasks on the page, there might be issues with uploading the files to be labeled. This problem might occur with images.

The third thing to consider is quality control and assignment review. If you use recompletion of assignments from banned users, you should split the task into smaller parts so that fewer assignments are recompleted. You are more likely to meet your budget this way.
