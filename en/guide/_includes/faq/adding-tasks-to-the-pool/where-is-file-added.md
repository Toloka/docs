{% cut "Where is my file added if I upload it to the running pool?" %}

If you have the {% if locale == "en-com" %}**Keep task order**{% endif %} option enabled in the pool settings, labeling will start after the tasks you uploaded previously are taken by Tolokers. If this option is disabled, we can't guarantee that the tasks will be assigned in that order.
