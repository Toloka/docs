{% cut "Do users have to complete all the tasks in the training pool?" %}

If you enabled incomplete training and specified the number of training pages required, users don't have to fully complete the training in order to pass. If you didn't make these settings, the Tolokers have to complete all the tasks in the training pool to get a training skill.
