{% cut "Which format should I use to review results if I'm looking to filter out mismatching Tolokers based on the "Majority vote"?" %}

To assign a skill to or ban Tolokers based on the majority vote, add a relevant [rule](../../../concepts/mvote.md) to the pool.

Don't forget to enable **Keep task order from uploaded data** in the [pool parameters](../../../concepts/pool-main.md#pool-params). Majority vote is used in the projects with preset options (radio buttons or checkboxes). This rule won't apply to the text entry or file upload fields.
