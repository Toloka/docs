{% cut "I want to create training and exam pools to match the entered text against a sample, and sometimes the matching fails. How do I implement this?" %}

For a control or training assignment to be counted as correct, it must exactly match the control assignment. To do this, you need to normalize the response text using JavaScript: remove spaces, punctuation marks, special characters, and capital letters, and write the result in a separate output field. Now you can match the processed assignment text against your control text.

Another option for selecting Tolokers for a project of this type is assignment review (non-automatic acceptance).
