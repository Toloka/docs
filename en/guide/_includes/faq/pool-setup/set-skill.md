{% cut "Have I understood correctly that if I use `set the the skill value = 1` with the `accepted task suite responses (%) >= 75` and `10 recent values to use`, for every 8 correctly completed tasks out of 10 the Toloker is given 1 skill point?" %}

No, this is incorrect. With these settings, each time a rule condition is met, the Toloker gets `skill = 1`. To change the skill value in the process of task review, you need a “multi-step” rule, which has multiple identical rules with different values of **Total reviewed responses**.
