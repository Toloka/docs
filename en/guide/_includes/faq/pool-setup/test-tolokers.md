{% cut "How do I test users to determine which kinds of tasks they do better and assign them relevant tasks?" %}

You can add a [training pool](../../../../guide/concepts/train.md) to test your Tolokers. Based on the test results, assign skills to the Tolokers for the tasks they do best.

Then open your pools only to the Tolokers that have a certain skill: use [filters](../../../../guide/concepts/filters.md) for this.
