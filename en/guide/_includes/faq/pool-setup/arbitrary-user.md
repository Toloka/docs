{% cut "Can I add an arbitrary user as a Toloker?" %}

If the user mismatches your preset filter, they can't see the task. You can only remove the restricting filter from the pool. You can test the task in the [Sandbox](../../../../guide/concepts/sandbox.md) by adding the desired user to your trusted list.
