{% cut "Can I change overlap after the pool is started?" %}

Yes. [Open edit mode for the pool](../../../../guide/concepts/pool-edit.md) and set a new overlap value. You don't need to restart the pool. Updating the settings is usually fast, but if there are many tasks, it may take several minutes.

{% endcut %}
