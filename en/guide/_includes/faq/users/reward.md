{% cut "How do I reward Tolokers in addition to the basic task price?" %}

You can increase the basic task price for Tolokers that have a higher skill. To do this, set up [Dynamic pricing](../../../../guide/concepts/dynamic-pricing.md). If you want to motivate high-quality Tolokers regardless of their skill, use [rewards](../../../../guide/concepts/bonus.md). In your task instructions, specify the amount and conditions for the Toloker rewards.
