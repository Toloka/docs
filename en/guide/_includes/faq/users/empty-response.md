{% cut "Fraudulent Tolokers submit assignments with empty response fields. Are they going to be banned before the responses of other Tolokers are known?" %}

Fraudulent Tolokers aren't banned before the [majority vote](../../../../guide/concepts/mvote.md) is known. That's why we recommend that you have new Tolokers complete [training](../../../../guide/concepts/train.md) or a test. Then you can select the Tolokers that successfully completed the training to do your tasks.
