{% cut "Can I disable tasks for Tolokers who do a poor job on tasks?" %}

You can deny access to the pool if the Toloker's task suite responses are [too fast](../../../../guide/concepts/quick-answers.md), if they don't match the [majority vote](../../../../guide/concepts/mvote.md), or if the Toloker makes too many mistakes in [control tasks](../../../../guide/concepts/goldenset.md). Tasks completed by such Tolokers can be [given to other Tolokers](../../../../guide/concepts/restore-task-overlap.md).
