{% cut "I use Toloka-Kit. Do I have to do anything to switch to new 'toloka.dev' domain?" %}

If you are a user of Toloka-Kit version 1.0.0 and later, you are good to go, no need to do anything.

If your Toloka-Kit version is older than 1.0.0, please update it. You can do this with the help of the following command:

{% include [update-toloka-kit](shared/update-toloka-kit.md) %}

{% include [toloka-kit-release](shared/toloka-kit-release.md) %}

{% endcut %}
