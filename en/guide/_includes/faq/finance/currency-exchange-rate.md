{% cut "How do I find out the currency exchange rate that would apply to my account top-up in Toloka?" %}

You specify the top-up amount in USD. On the **Balance**, it's converted into rubles, including VAT. The conversion follows the Central Bank of Russia's exchange rate at the time of invoicing (UTC). [Learn more](../../../../guide/concepts/refill.md) about top-up.
