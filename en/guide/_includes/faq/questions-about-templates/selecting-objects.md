{% cut "How do I create a task for selecting objects in images?" %}

We recommend that you break down your object selection project into three projects in Toloka:

1. Sorting images containing an object.

    1. [Create a task](../../../../guide/tutorials/image-classification.md) using the “Image classification” preset.

    1. Sort the images containing the object you are looking for.

    1. Show the image to the Toloker and ask if the object is in the image. Task response options: Yes/No.

1. Selecting objects in images.

    1. Select the object in the images you obtained after the previous project. You already have such a project. Run the task with manual review.

    1. Use the quality control rules: fast responses, manual review, and post-review re-assessment. [Description of rules with examples](../../../../guide/concepts/control.md).

1. Reviewing object selection assignments.

    1. Create a task using the object selection template.

    1. Hide the editor and ask whether the object is selected correctly. Response options: Yes/No.

    1. In the input data, pass the images and coordinates of the labeled objects from the previous task.

    Now you can run the resulting pool with an overlap of 3–5 or with dynamic overlap. After that, you can aggregate the results and then upload the data for review to Project 2.

    To prevent the Tolokers who worked on the second project from doing the review, assign a skill to them. Use this skill as a filter in the pools of the third project.
