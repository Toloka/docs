{% cut "Is it possible to use the same account for the sandbox and the public Toloka version?" %}

No, you need a separate account for each version of Toloka. To create a task in the sandbox, [register](../../../../guide/concepts/access.md) in it as a requester. To complete your own task, register another account for yourself as a Toloker.
