{% cut "How long is the pool stored?" %}

If there is no activity in the pool for a month, it is [archived](../../../concepts/pool-archive.md). You can't run such a pool, but you can [clone](../../../concepts/pool-main.md#clone) it or [download the labeled data](../../../concepts/result-of-eval.md#file-download) from it.
