{% cut "The phone number belongs to another user" %}

If you see this warning, make sure you entered the phone number correctly.

Please note that you can only have one requester account per phone number (see the [User Agreement]({{ useragreement }})).

If your [Yandex ID]({{ phones }}) is linked to the wrong number, change it. For more information about linking a phone number, see [Yandex ID Help]({{ authorization-phone }}).

If you don't remember your credentials in Toloka, use [Restoring access]({{ restore }}).

If you deleted your Toloka account, create a new Yandex ID and register in Toloka.
