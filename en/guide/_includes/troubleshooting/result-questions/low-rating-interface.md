{% cut "Low rating for “Task interface usability”" %}

Make the interface [more user-friendly](../../../../guide/concepts/spec.md) and don't make the Toloker complete unnecessary actions. Use keyboard shortcuts.

Starting from December 15, 2021, tasks in pools are automatically available in the web version of Toloka and the mobile app. If your task isn't available on mobile devices, it means that you might have forgotten to add the {% if locale == "en-com" %}**Client**{% endif %} filter.
