{% cut "I add tasks to the pool via the create task method, but tasks are not created. What is the reason?" %}

You can upload tasks with the help of [create task](../../../../api/concepts/create-task.md) method to the pool that uses smart mixing only. If you want to use a pool without smart mixing, use the [create task suite](../../../../api/concepts/create-task-suite.md) method.
