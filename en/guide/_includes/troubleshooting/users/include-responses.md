{% cut "The results include the responses of users who I banned" %}

The results show the responses of all users, including those who are banned. To exclude their responses from the results, select the option **Exclude assignments by banned users**. It will delete the responses from users who were banned at the moment the results were downloaded, not when the pool was labeled.
