# Overview of survey solutions

To run a social science research, use one of Toloka solutions:
* [**Survey with Toloka template**](questionnaire-toloka.md):
    * For short and simple surveys.
    * To select Tolokers with specific characteristics. 
* [**Survey on third-party platform**](questionnaire-other.md):
    * For long and complicated surveys.
    * If you are already conducting the survey using other channels, and would like to aggregate all the results in one place.
* [**Survey based on Qualtrics**](questionnaire-qualtrics.md):
    * If you have an IRB-approved Qualtrics survey.
    * If you do no want to start a new survey on Toloka.
