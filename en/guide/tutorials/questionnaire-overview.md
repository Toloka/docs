# Overview

To run a research, use one of the Toloka survey solutions:

* [Survey with Toloka template](questionnaire-toloka.md)
    * For short and simple surveys.
    * To pre-select Tolokers for the second stage of your survey when the general audience settings in Toloka are not enough to filter respondents you need. 
    
* [Survey on third-party platform](questionnaire-other.md)
    * For long and complicated surveys.
    * If you are already conducting the survey using other channels to reach out to respondents, and would like to aggregate all the results in one place.
    * If you are used to another platform, and want to continue creating your new surveys there.    
    
* [Survey based on Qualtrics](questionnaire-qualtrics.md)
    * If you have a Qualtrics survey approved by an institutional review board (IRB), and you want Toloka to set up your project and accept Tolokers' responses automatically.
