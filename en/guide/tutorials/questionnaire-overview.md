# Overview

To run a social science research, use one of the Toloka survey solutions:

* [Survey with Toloka template](questionnaire-toloka.md):
    * For short and simple surveys.
    * To pre-select Tolokers for the second stage of your survey when the general settings are not enough to filter respondents you need. 
    
* [Survey on third-party platform](questionnaire-other.md):
    * For long and complicated surveys.
    * If you are already conducting the survey using other channels to reach out to respondents, and would like to aggregate all the results in one place.
    
* [Survey based on Qualtrics](questionnaire-qualtrics.md):
    * If you have an IRB-approved Qualtrics survey, and you do not want to start a new survey on Toloka. 


The comparison of the solutions is provided in the table below:
