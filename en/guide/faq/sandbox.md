# Sandbox

{% note tip %}

If you are looking for the answer to a specific question, use **Ctrl+F** to search the page (**Cmd+F** on MacOS).

{% endnote %}

{% cut "How do I work with the Sandbox?" %}

[Register]({{ sandbox }}) as a requester in the sandbox.

[Register]({{ sandbox-for-performers }}) as a Toloker using another account.

In your requester account, add your Toloker account to your trusted list.

Create and run a task. It will appear in the list of tasks for your trusted users. For more information, see [Help](../concepts/sandbox.md).

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I see my pool through the eyes of a Toloker?" %}

To test your task, add yourself as a trusted Toloker in the Sandbox. To do this, on the **Tolokers** page, click **Add trusted users**. Enter the username for the Toloker's account (case-sensitive).

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I check my project in the mobile version of Toloka?" %}

To do this, you will need a Sandbox version of the Toloka app. [Write to support](support.md#support-work-toloka) to get it.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Will a copy of the project exported from the Sandbox be updated in the main version if I edit the original?" %}

You won't be able to update a previously exported project. If you clone a project from the sandbox again, its current copy is added. The old project doesn't change.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I move control tasks from the Sandbox to the main pool?" %}

The tasks themselves are not exported, only the project configuration and the settings of the selected pool. You can download the completed tasks from the pool in the Sandbox and import them to the exported pool.

To download only the control tasks (if you completed them in the interface), go to **Mark up**, then click **Control tasks** and **Download**.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Is it possible to use the same account for the Sandbox and the public Toloka version?" %}

No, you need a separate account for each version of Toloka. To create a task in the [Sandbox](../../glossary.md#sandbox), [register](../concepts/access.md) in it as a requester. To complete your own task, register another account for yourself as a Toloker.
