1. Check the number you entered. You might have mistyped it.

1. Check the number in Yandex ID. It must be set as your main number. If a different number is specified in Yandex ID, an SMS code will be sent to that number.

You can also use the recommendations in [Yandex ID Help]({{ phone-problems_no-code }}). If this doesn't help, contact [support]({{ passport-support }}).

{% cut "How do I change my account type from “Requester” to “Toloker”?" %}

You can't change the account type from “Requester” to “Toloker”.

If you want to complete tasks, you need to register in Toloka once again, with a different username, but as a Toloker.

To create a Toloker account:

1. Log out of your requester account.

1. Go to the [Toloka]({{ toloka-index }}) home page.

1. Click **Join**.

1. Follow the system instructions.

{% note info %}

You can use the same phone number to create a new account. For a step-by-step description of the registration process, see [Registration and login]({{ user-documentation }}).

{% endnote %}

{% endcut %}

{% cut "The phone number belongs to another user" %}

If you see this warning, make sure you entered the phone number correctly.

Please note that you can only have one requester account per phone number (see the [User Agreement]({{ useragreement }})).

If your [Yandex ID]({{ phones }}) is linked to the wrong number, change it. For more information about linking a phone number, see [Yandex ID Help]({{ authorization-phone }}).

If you don't remember your credentials in Toloka, use [Restoring access]({{ restore }}).

If you deleted your Toloka account, create a new Yandex ID and register in Toloka.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I change the phone number in my account?" %}

To change your phone number, go to [Yandex ID]({{ phones }}) and change your main number.

{% note info %}

If you don't have access to the old number, it takes a month to replace it. For more information about changing the phone number, see [Yandex ID Help]({{ change-phone }}).
