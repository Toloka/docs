{% cut "When I top up my account, I see an amount 1000 times greater than I planned. What happened?" %}

That's normal. For example, if you entered $25 and you see "25,000", it's still $25 with a decimal delimiter. Your account will be topped up by $25 at the current exchange rate. You'll see the amount in rubles when you proceed to payment.
