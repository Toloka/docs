## Adding funds to your account {#concept-1}

{% cut "When I top up my account, I see an amount 1000 times greater than I planned. What happened?" %}

That's normal. For example, if you entered $25 and you see "25,000", it's still $25 with a decimal delimiter. Your account will be topped up by $25 at the current exchange rate. You'll see the amount in rubles when you proceed to payment.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How long does paying the invoice take?" %}

If you pay using a bank card, the money is usually transferred to your Toloka account within a few minutes. If you can't see the top-up amount on your account, [write to us](support.md#help) and we'll sort it out. Specify your requester username and account number and use **Account top-up** as your email subject.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I find out the currency exchange rate that would apply to my account top-up in Toloka?" %}

You specify the top-up amount in USD. On the **Balance**, it's converted into rubles, including VAT. [Learn more](../concepts/refill.md) about top-up.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I add money to Toloka?" %}

You can top up your Toloka account using a bank card or bank transfer. On the [Profile]({{ profile }}) page, click "Connect to billing", fill out the form, and you'll see the "Top up account" button. [Learn more](../concepts/refill.md#step-by-step) with step-by-step instructions.

## Payment for tasks {#concept-2}

{% cut "Where can I set the task price?" %}

You can set a price for your [task suite](../../glossary.md#task-suite) on the pool editing page. The minimum price is $0.005.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I set up a budget for my first task in Toloka?" %}

Here's the general rule of pricing: the more time is needed to complete the task, the higher the price is.

If the task is simple, like if the Toloker spends a few seconds to assess product relevance, then set the price to $0.01–$0.02 for 10 tasks (products) on the page.

If you register in Toloka as a Toloker, you can compare offers from other requesters.

Define the page price, multiply it by the overlap (it's usually 3–5 for a classification task) and add 20% VAT. Try topping up your account by $10 first, then continue topping it up based on the performance dynamics.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I pay more to users who fill out optional fields?" %}

You can issue rewards after completion and describe the criteria for increased rewards in your task instructions. You can't change the task suite price dynamically based on the completion results.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Where do I find the statistics on the awards I paid?" %}

Track your money debited for rewards in {% if locale == "en-com" %}**Profile** → **Spent**{% endif %} tab.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Can there be tasks with different prices in the pool?" %}

No. The price per task suite is the same for all tasks in the pool. You can create multiple pools with different prices or [change the price](../concepts/dynamic-pricing.md) depending on the Toloker skill using **Dynamic pricing**. You can [pay rewards](../concepts/bonus.md) to good Tolokers.
