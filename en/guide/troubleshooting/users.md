## Data about Tolokers {#user-info}

{% cut "More than 500 Tolokers passed the training, but the training skill shows only 30." %}

The pool shows the total number of Tolokers that completed at least one assignment. A training skill can be lost over time if you set repeated training in the pool settings. This setting allows a Toloker to pass the training again after a certain period if the Toloker didn't complete any tasks in associated pools or if there was a large time gap between completing tasks (for example, because of the [ban](../../glossary.md#banning-tolokers)). The training skill displays the Tolokers who either recently completed training, or regularly complete your tasks so that the skill doesn't expire.

## Cheaters {#cheaters}

{% cut "Tolokers completed the training successfully, but have poor results in the general task" %}

During the training, Tolokers follow the task instructions and practice completing your tasks. Based on the training results, the requester can select Tolokers who did well enough to get access to the main pool. However, the mere fact that the Toloker completes your training pool successfully does not guarantee that they will continue to demonstrate high-quality performance. Tolokers who did well on the training but had inadequate results in the general task might have obtained correct training responses from other people.

In addition to the training, be sure to set up [quality control rules](../concepts/control.md) in your main pools. This lets you control the quality throughout the task completion process. If the task requires that users send free-format responses or data files, use [non-automatic acceptance](../concepts/offline-accept.md) to pay for them only after reviewing the responses.

{% cut "The results include the responses of users who I banned" %}

The results show the responses of all users, including those who are banned. To exclude their responses from the results, select the option **Exclude assignments by banned users**. It will delete the responses from users who were banned at the moment the results were downloaded, not when the pool was labeled.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "My project has a trusted Toloker who was banned by the system" %}

Unfortunately, this Toloker has violated the Toloker agreement and will no longer be able to complete tasks. You can find new Tolokers or customize [filters](../concepts/filters.md) so that they better match the project requirements.
