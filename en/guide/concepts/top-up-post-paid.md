# Top up post-paid account

{% note info %}

Post-payment is only available to the clients who signed up a contract with Toloka.

{% endnote %}

Go to the [Profile](https://platform.toloka.ai/requester/profile) tab and click the **Top up account** button.

![Click Top up account button](../_images/top-up/top-up-account.png =700x)

Specify the transfer amount, select the **Bank transfer/PayPal** type, and click **Top up**.

After that the browser redirects to the **Ya Balance** service page.

Do not miss the most important thing â€” to switch on the **Pay on credit** option:

- If the checkbox is enabled, then post-payment will be triggered, and the money from the customer's credit limit will be used.

- If the checkbox is disabled, then this is a prepayment, and the customer will simply be billed, and the money will not be credited to Toloka until the bill is paid.

Choose **Pay on credit** and click the **Pay** button.
