# Registration

## Before you start {#concept_ntn_h5l_vlb}

To register, you need a Yandex ID with a linked and confirmed phone number. If you don't have a Yandex ID, sign up for one.

{% note alert "Restriction" %}

- If you're already registered as a Toloker, you'll need another Yandex ID.

- You can only register one requester account and one Toloker account per phone number in each version of Toloka.

{% endnote %}

## Where should I register? {#register}

There are two versions of Toloka. You need to register separately in each of them:

- [Production version]({{ toloka-ai }}) of Toloka for requesters.

- [Sandbox]({{ sandbox }}). You don't have to register in the sandbox, but it's useful for testing complex [projects](../../glossary.md#project) before launching them. Learn more about [working in the sandbox](sandbox.md).

## Recommendations {#concept_pkf_nks_vlb}

- To avoid confusion, use the same Yandex ID to register as a requester both in the production version and sandbox.

- We recommend setting up notifications immediately after registration. To do this, go to **Profile** and then **Notifications**.

- Use [shared access](multiple-access.md) if:

    - You want to be able to quickly switch from the Toloker account to the requester account.

    - You are planning to share projects with coworkers.

    - You need help setting up the project.
