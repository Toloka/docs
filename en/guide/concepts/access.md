# Registration

## Before you start {#concept_ntn_h5l_vlb}

To register, you need a Yandex ID with a linked and confirmed phone number. If you don't have a Yandex ID, sign up for one.

{% note alert "Restriction" %}

- If you're already registered as a Toloker, you'll need another Yandex ID.

- You can only register one requester account and one Toloker account per phone number in each version of Toloka.

{% endnote %}

## Where should I register? {#register}

There are two versions of Toloka. You need to register separately in each of them:

- [Production version]({{ toloka-ai }}) of Toloka for requesters.

- [Sandbox]({{ sandbox }}). You don't have to register in the sandbox, but it's useful for testing complex [projects](../../glossary.md#project) before launching them. Learn more about [working in the sandbox](sandbox.md).

## Recommendations {#concept_pkf_nks_vlb}

- To avoid confusion, use the same Yandex ID to register as a requester both in the production version and sandbox.

- We recommend setting up notifications immediately after registration. To do this, go to **Profile** and then **Notifications**.

- Use [shared access](multiple-access.md) if:

    - You want to be able to quickly switch from the Toloker account to the requester account.

    - You are planning to share projects with coworkers.

    - You need help setting up the project.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

{% cut "I can't complete registration as an “individual requester”. I'm not getting an SMS code." %}

1. Check the number you entered. You might have mistyped it.

1. Check the number in Yandex ID. It must be set as your main number. If a different number is specified in Yandex ID, an SMS code will be sent to that number.

You can also use the recommendations in [Yandex ID Help]({{ phone-problems_no-code }}). If this doesn't help, contact [support]({{ passport-support }}).

{% endcut %}

{% cut "The phone number belongs to another user" %}

If you see this warning, make sure you entered the phone number correctly.

Please note that you can only have one requester account per phone number (see the [User Agreement]({{ useragreement }})).

If your [Yandex ID]({{ phones }}) is linked to the wrong number, change it. For more information about linking a phone number, see [Yandex ID Help]({{ authorization-phone }}).

If you don't remember your credentials in Toloka, use [Restoring access]({{ restore }}).

If you deleted your Toloka account, create a new Yandex ID and register in Toloka.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I change the phone number in my account?" %}

To change your phone number, go to [Yandex ID]({{ phones }}) and change your main number.

{% note info %}

If you don't have access to the old number, it takes a month to replace it. For more information about changing the phone number, see [Yandex ID Help]({{ change-phone }}).

{% endnote %}

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I change my account type from “Requester” to “Toloker”?" %}

You can't change the account type from “Requester” to “Toloker”.

If you want to complete tasks, you need to register in Toloka once again, with a different username, but as a Toloker.

To create a Toloker account:

1. Log out of your requester account.

1. Go to the [Toloka]({{ toloka-index }}) home page.

1. Click **Join**.

1. Follow the system instructions.

{% note info %}

You can use the same phone number to create a new account. For a step-by-step description of the registration process, see [Registration and login]({{ user-documentation }}).
