# Global skills

This is a special type of skills in Toloka that show the general competencies of Tolokers, such as text processing or selecting objects in images.

#### Benefits:

- Use global skills if you want to quickly launch a project and recruit Tolokers who are good at certain types of tasks.

- Our experiments show that global skills combined with traditional quality control methods increase the correctness and consistency of labeling.

#### Keep in mind the following:

- Requesters don't create this type of skills.

- Global skills are created by the system based on user responses to the projects of the same type.

- Toloker skills are updated daily by the Toloka team.

- Restrictions of the `skill >80` type are used to select “Tolokers who completed similar projects better on average than 80% of other Tolokers”.

To use this feature, select {% if locale == "en-com" %}**Add a filter → Skills → Choose a global skill**{% endif %} and specify the restriction for the selected skill in the added filter.
