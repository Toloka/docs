# Amazon S3

{% note info %}

You can use any photo hosting service to add a small number of images, such as [imgbb]({{ imgbb }}), [ImageShack]({{ imageshack }}), or [imgur]({{ imgur }}). This way you can quickly get direct links to your images to add them to the task file or instructions.

    Files will be accessible to anyone with a link. We recommend using hashed file names to keep your files secure. You can generate hashes using online tools (for example, [Online MD5 Hash Generator]({{ hash-function-wiki }})). Learn more about [hashing]({{ hash-function-wiki }}).

## Upload files to the bucket {#upload}

1. In the **Buckets** section, select a bucket.

    ![](../_images/tutorials/cloud-storage/amazon/upload.png)

1. {% cut "Upload files" %}

    Select the files on your computer and click **Add files**.

    {% endcut %}

    {% cut "Upload a folder with files" %}

    Select the folder with the files on your computer and click **Add folder**.

    {% endcut %}

    {% cut "Create a folder and upload files" %}

    To create a folder in the bucket, click **Create folder** and upload files.

    {% endcut %}

    {% note info %}

    All symbols except for Latin letters will be replaced with codes, and spaces will be replaced with plus signs.

    {% endnote %}

1. Click **Upload**.

1. After the files are uploaded, click **Close**.

## Copy links. {#get-files}

1. Select the uploaded file and click **Copy URL** on the **Object** tab.

    ![](../_images/tutorials/cloud-storage/amazon/overview.png)

1. All file links are created by the same template.

    Links look like this:

    ```plaintext
    https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region-code>.amazonaws.com/<filename>
    ```

    The link in the folder looks like this:

    ```plaintext
    https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region-code>.amazonaws.com/<path-to-file>/<filename>
    ```

    {% note info %}

    To quickly get links to other files, copy the link to one of them and replace `<file-name>` with the names of other files.

    {% endnote %}

1. In the [file with tasks](pool_csv.md), paste the links in the column that matches the input data field to which this data is passed.

    For example, if you want to use images in the `image` field, specify the file links in the `INPUT:image` column:

    ```plaintext
    INPUT:image
    https://mybucket.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/newfolder/image1.png
    https://mybucket.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/newfolder/image2.png
    ```
