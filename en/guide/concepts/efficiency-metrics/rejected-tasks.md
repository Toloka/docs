# Rejected tasks

This indicator shows the percentage of rejected tasks. If the tasks are rejected too often, you should review the project settings.

#### Features

- Only tasks with assignment review are considered.

- The percentage is calculated for the last 2 days.

#### How to calculate

$P_{reject} = \frac{T_{reject}}{T_{subm}}\times100$

where:

- $P_{reject}$ is the percentage of rejected tasks.

- $T_{reject}$ is the number of rejected tasks.

- $T_{subm}$ is the number of submitted tasks.

#### How to estimate

- A good indicator is `< 30%`.

- A low indicator is `> 30%`.
