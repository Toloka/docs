# Bans

This indicator shows the percentage of banned Tolokers. A high percentage may indicate incorrect quality control settings.

#### Features

- The entire project is taken into account, since a ban is usually imposed for the entire project.

- System bans are not taken into account.

- The percentage is calculated for the last 2 days.

#### How to calculate

$P_{ban} = \frac{N_{ban}}{N_{total}}\times100$

where:

- $P_{ban}$ is the percentage of banned Tolokers.

- $N_{ban}$ is the number of banned Tolokers.

- $N_{total}$ is the total number of Tolokers.

#### How to estimate

- A good indicator is `< 20%`.

- A low indicator is `> 20%`.
