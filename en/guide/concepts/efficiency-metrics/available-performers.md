# Project availability

This indicator shows the number of Tolokers currently available in [pool](../../../glossary.md#pool). It takes into account the following filters:

- If there are few performers, then itâ€™s worth reviewing the filter conditions.

- If there're too many Tolokers available, this may have a negative impact on the labeling quality. In this case, you can set up stricter filtering conditions or add additional filters.

#### How to estimate

- A good indicator is `> 300` available Tolokers.

- A low indicator is `< 300` available Tolokers.
