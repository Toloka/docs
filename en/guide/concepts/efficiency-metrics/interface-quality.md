# Quality of interface

After completing a task, Tolokers rate different aspects of it. In particular, they indicate whether the interface is user-friendly. Based on these ratings, an interface quality indicator is generated.

{% note info %}

If no Toloker has yet given a rating, the indicator value will be missing.

{% endnote %}

## How to calculate

$Q_{i} = {CSI}$

where:

- $Q_{i}$ is the interface quality indicator.

- $CSI$ is the Tolokers' rating, which shows how satisfied they are with the interface.

## How to estimate

- A good indicator is `> 4.5`.

- A low indicator is `< 4.5` or missing.
