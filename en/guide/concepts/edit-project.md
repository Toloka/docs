# Editing a project

You can view the list of created [projects](../../glossary.md#project) on the **Projects** page. Open the project page to view the [list of pools](pool-main.md), [the project rating](project_rating_stat.md) and [the project statistics](project-statistic.md).

To edit project parameters, click ![](../_images/location-job/project/edit-project.svg) in the list of projects or {% if locale == "en-com" %}**Project actions â†’ Edit**{% endif %} on the project page.

{% note alert %}

If you edit a [required field](incoming.md#required), the changes apply only to new [pools](pool-main.md). Existing [pools](../../glossary.md#pool) will continue using the previous version of the project.

{% endnote %}
