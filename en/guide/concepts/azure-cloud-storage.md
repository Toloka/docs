# Azure Blob Storage

{% note info %}

You can use any photo hosting service to add a small number of images, such as [imgbb]({{ imgbb }}), [ImageShack]({{ imageshack }}), or [imgur]({{ imgur }}). This way you can quickly get direct links to your images to add them to the task file or instructions.

{% endnote %}

To try [Microsoft Azure]({{ azure-blob }}), create a [free account]({{ azure-free }}).

## Create a container {#container}

1. In the **Data storage** section in the left menu, select **Containers**.

1. On the top panel, click ![](../_images/tutorials/cloud-storage/azure/plus-icon.svg) **Container**.

1. Enter the container name.

1. In the **Public access level** field, select **Container**.

    {% note info %}

    Files will be accessible to anyone with a link. We recommend using hashed file names to keep your files secure. You can generate hashes using online tools (for example, [Online MD5 Hash Generator]({{ hash-function-wiki }})). Learn more about [hashing]({{ hash-function-wiki }}).

    {% endnote %}

1. Click **Create**.

{% note info %}

You can set up the lifetime of files in the container so that they are automatically deleted after a specified number of days. [Learn more]({{ azure-ttl }}).

{% endnote %}

## Upload your files to the container {#upload}

1. To open the container, click on its name.

1. On the top panel, click ![](../_images/tutorials/cloud-storage/azure/send-icon.png) **Send**.

1. {% cut "Upload files" %}

    Select files on your device.

    {% endcut %}

    {% cut "Upload files to the folder." %}

    In the **Send to folder** field in the **Additional** section, enter the name of the folder. If the folder doesn't exist, it will be created.

    {% endcut %}

    {% note warning %}

    The name can't contain spaces. Files can't be accessed by link.

    {% endnote %}

1. Click **Send**.

## Copy links {#get-files}

1. Select the uploaded file and copy its **URL** from the **Review** section.

1. All file links are created by the same template.

    Links look like this:

    ```plaintext
    https://<storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<filename>
    ```

    The link in the folder looks like this:

    ```plaintext
    https://<storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<file-path>/<filename>
    ```

    {% note info %}

    To quickly get links to other files, copy the link to one of them and replace `<file-name>` with the names of other files.

    {% endnote %}

1. In the [file with tasks](pool_csv.md), paste the links in the column that matches the input data field to which this data is passed.

    For example, if you want to use images in the `image` field, specify the file links in the `INPUT:image` column:

    ```plaintext
    INPUT:image
    https://mytolokaaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/newfolder/image1.png
    https://mytolokaaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/newfolder/image2.png
    ```
