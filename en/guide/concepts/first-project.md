# Your first project

Learn your way around Toloka with the following steps:

1. [Create a project](#create-project).
1. [Configure a task pool](#configure-pool).
1. [Upload a file with tasks](#upload-tasks).
1. [Launch the pool and get the results](#get-results).

## Before you start {#before-start}

Make sure you're [registered](access.md) as a requester.

Log in to the [Sandbox](sandbox.md) to create and test your project for free. This helps you avoid making mistakes and spending unnecessary money on a task that doesn't work.

## Step 1. Create a project {#create-project}

In the project, you'll customize an appearance of the tasks.

1. On the **Projects** tab, choose a project preset that matches your task. The preset has preconfigured settings, a template for the task interface, and sample instructions for Tolokers. You will need to make a few changes in the interface and instructions to fit your data.

    {% cut "Presets for popular tasks" %}

    - **Image classification**

        Designed to determine which category an image belongs to.

    - **Product search relevance**

        Intended to rate how relevant products are to specific search queries.

    - **Object recognition & detection**

        Used to outline objects on images for training computer vision to detect them.

    - **Customer survey**

        Designed to collect information for research purposes.

    {% endcut %}

    {% note tip %}

    If you unsure which preset to choose, you can ask Toloka experts to create a project for you. To do that,

    - click **Get expert help**,
    - select the way Toloka can contact you (WhatsApp, Telegram, Viber, email, or phone),
    - enter your phone number or email address,
    - briefly describe the project and the results you want to get.

    Toloka engineering team will contact you for more details and explain your further steps.

    {% endnote %}

    If you can't find a preset that works for you, choose **Blank** to set up a project from scratch. To learn how, see the [Initial project settings](project.md) section.

1. In the **General information** section, fill in the project name and a brief explanation of what will happen within the project.

1. In the **Task interface** section, do the following:

    1. Select **Template builder**.

    1. Edit the preset task interface to configure the task appearance.

    1. Click **Show specifications** to see the generated input and output data fields.

    To learn more, see the [Template Builder Help](../../template-builder/index.md).

1. In the **Instructions for Tolokers** section, edit the ready-made instructions if needed.

1. Click **Create a project**.

## Step 2. Configure a task pool {#configure-pool}

A pool is a set of tasks sent out for completion at the same time. Create and configure the pool as follows:

1. On the project page, click **Create new pool**.

1. Configure the pool parameters:

    - Set a price per [task suite](../../glossary.md#task-suite) and [overlap](../../glossary.md#overlap). The minimum price is $0.005.

    - Use filters to select Tolokers who will have access to your tasks.

    - Add and configure quality control rules to get more accurate responses. You can use a quality control preset with default settings. In the **Quality Control** section, click **Add a quality control rule** and choose a suitable preset.

        ![](../_images/first-project/quality-control-presets.png)

1. Click **Create pool**.

## Step 3. Upload a file with tasks {#upload-tasks}

A task is the data you want Tolokers to label. Each image or comment is a separate task.

To upload a [file with tasks](../../glossary.md#tsv):

1. Click {% if locale == "en-com" %}**Upload data**{% endif %}.

1. Download the template that matches your task type.

    Task types:

    - General — tasks that you don't have answers for, and you want to get responses from Tolokers.

    - Control — tasks that you know the correct answers to. It is used for checking Tolokers.

    - Training — tasks with correct answers and hints. It is used for training Tolokers to complete a task.

1. Add the tasks data to the template. For a trial pool, 10–100 tasks is enough.

1. Attach the file with the tasks.

1. Click {% if locale == "en-com" %}**Continue**{% endif %}.

1. Choose a way to put tasks into suites: {% if locale == "en-com" %}**Smart mixing**{% endif %} or {% if locale == "en-com" %}**Set manually**{% endif %}. For more information, see [Ways to group tasks in suites](distribute-tasks-by-pages.md).

1. Click {% if locale == "en-com" %}**Combine tasks into suites**{% endif %}.

1. Click **Preview** to make sure that your tasks look correctly.

1. Use control tasks to improve Tolokers' task completion quality.

    {% note tip %}

    To save time, you can opt for [having your control tasks created](task_markup.md) by Toloka experts.

    {% endnote %}

## Step 4. Launch the pool and get the results {#get-results}

1. Start the pool by clicking **Start labeling**. This assigns the tasks to the Tolokers.

    ![](../_images/first-project/start-pool.png)

1. [Complete your tasks](sandbox.md#self) as a Toloker by yourself.

1. Track your project with the real-time statistics on the pool and project pages.

1. When the tasks are completed, get the results:

    - Download a [TSV file](result-of-eval.md) with the responses.

    - If you have used overlap, run [aggregation](result-aggregation.md) to get the final results.

    - Get the [files](result-of-eval.md) that Tolokers have attached to the tasks.

## What's next {#what-next}

- When you complete the testing in the Sandbox, [move](sandbox.md#export) your project to the Toloka production version and launch the pool for real Tolokers.

- View our [tutorials](usecases.md). Perhaps there is an instruction that fits your task, and you will only need to insert your own data.

- If you don't like Template Builder, try out the [HTML/JS/CSS editor](spec.md).

- See the [Toloka API](../../api/index.md) documentation to learn how to manage your projects via the API.

- If you have questions or problems, see the [Troubleshooting and support](../troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md) section.
