# Managing the requester's personal account

To send tasks for completion, you must have money in your Toloka account. For more information, see [Topping up your account](refill.md).

All payments between requesters and Tolokers are made in U.S. dollars. The account balance is shown in the main menu:

![](../_images/other/balance-ru.png)

- The green number is the account balance.

- Gray indicates funds reserved for the tasks waiting to be [reviewed](../../glossary.md#assignment-review).

Money in the account is spent on the following items:

- [Payment per task](#task-payment)

- [Fee](#comission)

- [Rewards for Tolokers](bonus.md)

You can [track spending](#track-budget) in your profile. You can also download a task report in a PDF file. To monitor the funds available in your account, [set up notifications](#money-notification).

## Payment per task {#task-payment}

The price of a task is set by the requester in the [pool settings](../../glossary.md#pool). Money is deducted from the account as tasks are completed. If you [review assignments](accept.md) after they are completed, the money for [completed tasks](../../glossary.md#completed-tasks) is first reserved, and then deducted.

## Fees {#comission}

The requester is charged a fee for using Toloka — a percentage of the cost of tasks including [rewards](bonus.md).

The amount by project is shown in your [profile]({{ profile }}) (on the **Spent** tab). You can see total fees for the pool tasks on the pool page (the **Budget spent (+ markup)** and **Approximate budget (+ markup)** fields).

## Expenses in the requester's profile {#track-budget}

To see your spending history:

1. Go to the [requester profile]({{ profile }}) and switch to the **Spent** tab.

1. Under the **Spending history** title, select a period.

1. Select the type of the expenses:

    - **All costs** —  all expenses for the period.

    - **Reserved** — reserved money for the period.

1. In the section below you will see:

    - **Total spent** — the sum of all payments and fees for the selected period.

    - **Reserved money** — funds reserved for the tasks waiting to be reviewed.

    - Details by dates in the **Payment** and in the **Fees** columns.

## Notifications of account status {#money-notification}

To get notifications when you have less than 5 dollars left on your account:

1. Go to the [requester profile]({{ profile }}) and switch to the **Notifications** tab.

1. In the **Low funds** row, choose which notification method to use:

    - **Browser** — push notifications will appear at the bottom of the screen. To enable notifications in the browser, click **Turn on** in the **Browser** column.

    - **Messages** — notifications will be displayed on the [Messages]({{ messages }}) page.

    - **Email** — notifications will be sent to the email specified in your profile.

## Main and secondary accounts {#parent-child-accounts}

Requesters who opted for a paper contract can create main and secondary accounts.

#### Limitations:

- Only accounts without any projects can be main and secondary accounts.

- We recommend the post-paid type of contract for main and secondary accounts.

#### Keep in mind the following:

- General [skills](../../glossary.md#skill).

- Each secondary account has its own password and username.

- You can't convert a secondary account into the main one.

- Payments are only available for the main account, from which the funds are distributed to secondary accounts.

- Financial reports and closing documents are issued to the main account and are not sent to secondary accounts.

If you want to create main and secondary accounts, [write to support](../troubleshooting/support.md).
