# Viewing Tolokers

The [Tolokers]({{ users }}) page shows all Tolokers who opened at least one of your tasks. On this page, you can select Tolokers to:

- [Assign or take away a skill](nav.md).

- [Block or unblock access](ban.md). For example, if you blocked a Toloker by mistake.

- [Issue a reward](bonus.md) for good performance. Loyal Tolokers will complete your tasks more willingly.

{% include [select-tolokers](../_includes/select-tolokers.md) %}

You can download the list of the chosen Tolokers. To do this, click **Download .xls** at the top right.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

{% cut "Can I use a skill beyond a particular pool or project and apply it to other projects as well?" %}

Yes, of course â€” you can use the same skill for different projects. But most often, a skill is intended for a specific project. If the Toloker completes a certain task well, this doesn't mean that they will complete other ones successfully. Another disadvantage is that if you filter by skills that were set long ago, you will artificially limit the number of available Tolokers.

{% cut "How do I view information about Tolokers?" %}

You can view information about Tolokers of your tasks on the [Tolokers]({{ users }}) page. To view information about a Toloker, select their ID. The requester can access the following data in the Toloker profile: country and city, age, education, language skills. On the **Metainformation** tab, you can find the versions of the browser and operating system, the User-agent type, region detected by IP, and other Toloker parameters. To select the Tolokers for your [pool](../../glossary.md#pool) based on their profile, device, geo location, and other parameters, use [filters](filters.md).
