# Viewing Tolokers

The [Tolokers]({{ users }}) page shows all Tolokers who opened at least one of your tasks. On this page, you can select Tolokers to:

- [Assign or take away a skill](nav.md).

- [Block or unblock access](ban.md). For example, if you blocked a Toloker by mistake.

- [Issue a reward](bonus.md) for good performance. Loyal Tolokers will complete your tasks more willingly.
