# Starting and stopping a task pool

You can start a [pool](../../glossary.md#pool) if:

1. You uploaded tasks into it.

1. You have enough money in [your account](budget.md) to pay for the pool tasks, including the [overlap](../../glossary.md#overlap).

To start the pool, click ![](../_images/other/b-start-pool.svg) on the pool page or ![](../_images/tutorials/content-moderation/pool-action-play.svg) in the list of pools on the [project](../../glossary.md#project) page.

A started pool has the status “Open”. When all pool tasks are completed, the pool automatically switches to the “Closed” status.

To stop assigning the pool tasks before all of them are completed, click ![](../_images/other/b-pause-pool.svg) on the pool page or ![](../_images/tutorials/content-moderation/pool-action-pause.svg) in the list of pools on the project page.

{% note tip %}

New tasks can be uploaded to an open or closed pool.
