# Checking project

After you [uploaded the files](task_upload.md) with the tasks to the pool, complete the tasks as a Toloker. This way you can find if the project contains any errors, or might be too difficult or ambiguous for the Tolokers to complete.

It also allows you to fix potential issues with your tasks even before you send them to the real Tolokers for labeling. This will save your money and Tolokers efforts.

To label the project tasks as a Toloker, click **Try tasks as a Toloker** at the pool overview page.

![Check the project before you start labeling](../_images/self-labeling.png =700x)

We recommend that you pay attention to the following aspects:

{% cut "Task interface visible to Tolokers" %}

Check how Tolokers see the interface parts:

- Texts and media files: whether they look good, the text and other content isn't overlapped or cut off.

- The correct work of the interactive elements: buttons, text boxes, links, and options all work the way they're supposed to.

- Task response validation works as expected (if applicable to your project): if the task involves entering a phone number or email address, it's important to validate the format.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Task instructions Tolokers will see" %}

During this special labeling mode, you'll be working with real data that you uploaded to the pool. This is a good chance to check if your instructions account for every possible scenario that Tolokers may encounter when completing the task.

Make sure that your instructions:

- Include input data, task explanations, and examples of complex cases.
- Are simple and clear enough that even Tolokers who have never done this type of task before can follow along with ease.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Task labeling process" %}

- Divide the main project task that you have in mind into short, uniform tasks which Tolokers can quickly complete.

- Check how much time it takes you to complete each task. Tolokers should have enough time for that. At the same time, it shouldn't be too long, or the Tolokers will get tired and won't complete the tasks or the result will be bad.

- See how many steps are involved and if it is possible to avoid doing something or reduce the number of answers.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Output format" %}

Check the results and make sure there are no errors, and the format meets your expectations after the Tolokers complete your tasks. For example, if you're collecting phone numbers, make sure they're in the format you need, or if you have multiple response options, check that the labels match the names of your radio buttons.

{% endcut %}

If you discover issues with your project or tasks during the project check, you can fix them all before you launch your project and real Tolokers complete your tasks. Go back and edit your project settings. Tweak the task interface and instructions as much as you need to. Once that's done, your project is ready to launch.

We recommend that you always double-check new projects. You should also check previously created projects whenever you modify their interface or instructions.

## What's next {#what-next}

- If you haven't labeled your control and training tasks in the file, [edit the tasks in the interface](task_markup.md).
- [Top up](refill.md) your account.
- Launch the [pool labeling](pool-run-and-stop.md).
