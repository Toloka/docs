# Tips for designing tasks

This section includes links to sections of the guide and blog posts with tips and recommendations for creating tasks.

## Where to create tasks {#where}

To make it easier and faster to launch projects in Toloka, we developed a new tool — Template Builder. It is a user-friendly **JSON** interface editor.

Read in the blog:

- Learn about the benefits of Template Builder and how to use it in the article {% if locale == "en-com" %}[Template Builder in Toloka]({{ toloka-blog-template-builder-en }}){% endif %}.

{% if locale == "en-com" %}

## How to create tasks {#how}

#|
||**Decomposition** | **Task interface**||
||Tolokers do better with short, uniform tasks. Use decomposition to simplify your task. This will help lower costs and improve the quality of the results.

Learn more about the benefits of decomposition and when to use it in [Task decomposition](solution-architecture.md).

You can also read [Mistakes related to project architecture](frequent-customer-errors.md). | A clear and user-friendly interface improves the quality of results, helps Tolokers complete tasks faster, and lets you set a lower price per task.

## Uploading tasks {#download-task}

If your tasks are not displayed or are displayed incorrectly, Tolokers are unable to complete them, and you lose time and money.

## How to get good responses {#how-to-get}

#|
||**Quality control rules** | **Filters**||
||Quality control rules allow you to get more accurate responses and restrict access to tasks to cheating Tolokers.

Read the following sections:

- [Mistakes in quality control settings](frequent-customer-errors.md)
- [How to check Tolokers](check-performers.md) | Properly configured filters help you filter out Tolokers and send tasks to a target group of Tolokers. As a result, you'll get your results faster and spend less money.
