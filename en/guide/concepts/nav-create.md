# Creating a skill

To create a skill:

1. Click **+ Add skill** on the [Skills]({{ skills }}) page.

1. Enter the name of a new skill into the **Title** field. The skill name should be short, clear and easy to distinguish from the names of other skills.

1. Describe the skill in the **Description** field.

1. Choose the value of the **Public?** option:

    - **No** — The default value. Tolokers will not be able to see the information about the skill.

    - **Yes** — Tolokers will see the name and the value of the assigned skill.

1. Click **Add**.

{% note tip %}

To better motivate Tolokers, make the skill public and set [dynamic pricing](../../glossary.md#dynamic-pricing) based on this skill. In the task instructions, write what affects the skill value. Tolokers will know how the skill affects the price, and try to perform the tasks well.
