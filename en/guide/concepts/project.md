# Create a project

If you already have a project and you want to create an identical one, [clone](#clone) the existing project. If not, create a new project.

## New project {#new-project}

The project defines what the task will look like for a Toloker.

To get better results, make tasks as simple as possible and divide complex tasks into several projects.

{% note info %}

You can first create and test your project for free in the [sandbox](sandbox.md) and then [move](sandbox.md#export) it to the Toloka production version.

{% endnote %}

To create a project, follow the instructions:

#### In the interface:

1. Choose a preset:

    1. Click the **Create project** button on the **Projects** page.

    1. Choose a preset. The preset contains pre-configured [input and output data fields](incoming.md) and [the task interface](spec.md), which you can edit.

        If there is no suitable preset, choose an empty preset.

        {% note tip %}

        If you unsure which preset to choose, you can ask Toloka experts to create a project for you. To do that,

        - click **Get expert help**,
        - select the way Toloka can contact you (WhatsApp, Telegram, Viber, email, or phone),
        - enter your phone number or email address,
        - briefly describe the project and the results you want to get.

        Toloka engineering team will contact you for more details and explain your further steps.

        {% endnote %}

1. Provide general information:

    1. Enter the **Name** and **Description**. Tolokers will see this in the task list.

    1. Optionally add a **Private comment**.

1. Edit the task interface:

    {% list tabs %}

    - Template Builder

      1. [Create the task interface](../../template-builder/index.md).

      1. Click **Show specifications** to see the input and output data fields.

          Input data fields are created from the code on the **Example of input data** tab.

          The output data fields depend on the components that use `data.output` and values supported by it.

          Learn more about [input and output data fields](../../template-builder/operations/create-specs.md) in the Template Builder Help.

      1. Specify the settings for field task display if you use one of the field task templates.

    - HTML/JS/CSS editor

      1. [Describe the task interface](spec.md).

      1. Add fields for [input and output data](incoming.md) in the **Data specification** block.

      1. Specify the settings for field task display if you use one of the field task templates.

    {% endlist %}

1. [Write guidelines](instruction.md) for Tolokers.

    You can prepare instructions in HTML format, then copy and paste into the editor. Click **<>** to switch to HTML mode.

1. Optionally, add translations to other languages.

    1. Select the source language and the target languages.

    1. Fill in the fields in the table.

    1. Click **Finish**.

1. {% include [personal-data](../_includes/toloka-requester-source/id-toloka-requester-source/personal-data.md) %}


After creating the project, add a [task pool](pool-main.md) to it. You can also set up [quality control](control.md) in the project.

{% include [project-moderation](../_includes/toloka-requester-source/id-toloka-requester-source/project-moderation.md) %}

## Cloning a project {#clone}

You can view the list of created projects on the **Projects** page. Open the project page to view the list of pools, [project rating](project_rating_stat.md), and [project statistics](project-statistic.md).

To clone a project, click ![](../_images/location-job/project/clone-project.svg) in the list of projects or select **Project actions â†’ Clone** on the project page.

{% note warning %}

Quality control in the project is not cloned.

{% endnote %}

If you need to change the project settings, [open edit mode](edit-project.md).
