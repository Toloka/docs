# view.video

Player for video playback.

The player is a rectangular block with a frame and buttons to control the video. You can set the block size using the `ratio`, `fullHeight`, `minWidth`, and `maxWidth` properties.

The video resolution does not affect the size of the block — the video will fit into the block and will not be cropped.
