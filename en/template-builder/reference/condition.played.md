# condition.played

Checks the start of playback. Validation will be passed if playback is started. To play media with the `condition.played` check, you can use [view.audio](view.audio.md) and [view.video](view.video.md). The `condition.played` check only works in the player's `validation` property.

[View example in the sandbox](https://clck.ru/asS9J).
