# condition.played-fully

This component checks for the end of playback. Validation is passed if playback is finished. To play media with the `condition.played-fully` check, you can use [view.audio](view.audio.md) and [view.video](view.video.md). The `condition.played-fully` check only works in the player's `validation` property.
