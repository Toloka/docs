# condition.same-domain

Checks if the link that you entered belongs to a specific site. If it does, returns `true`, otherwise, `false`.

Links must be specified in full, including the protocol (http, https, ftp).

The `www.` subdomain is ignored when checking, meaning that links to `www.example.com` and `example.com` are considered to be the same.

How to pass a link address:

- Specify it explicitly as a string.
- [Get the value from your data](../operations/work-with-data.md).
- Refer to another element using `$ref`.
- Use [helpers](helpers.md) and [conditions](conditions.md) to get the value.
