# Video analysis

For this type of project, you can use the  template (). Note that validation, keyboard shortcuts, and task layout are already configured in this example.

#### Components used in the example

- [view.video](../reference/view.video.md): Video player.
- [condition.played](../reference/condition.played.md): Checks that the user started watching the video.
- [field.button-radio-group](../reference/field.button-radio-group.md): Buttons for answer options.
- [condition.required](../reference/condition.required.md): Checks if at least one option is selected.
- [plugin.toloka](../reference/plugin.toloka.md): Customizes the task layout.
- [plugin.hotkeys](../reference/plugin.hotkeys.md): [Keyboard shortcuts](../best-practices/hotkeys.md).

{% note info %}

You can add
{% cut "media files" %}

audio files, videos, images

{% endcut %}

 from your own server, [Yandex.Disk](../reference/helper.proxy.md), or cloud storage like [Yandex.Cloud]({{ toloka-requester-concepts-yacloud-dita }}), Google Cloud, or Amazon AWS.

{% endnote %}



## What else can be configured {#add-more}

- To [check](../best-practices/conditions.md) whether the user watched the whole video, replace the [condition.played](../reference/condition.played.md) component with [condition.played-fully](../reference/condition.played-fully.md).


If this template doesn't meet your needs, see other examples in this section.


## Other options for buttons {#add-variants}

Decide whether the performer can select only one or multiple answer options:

#### Multiple options (checkboxes)

Add a group of checkboxes using the [field.checkbox-group](../reference/field.checkbox-group.md) component.

#### One option (a radio button)

The [field.button-radio-group](../reference/field.button-radio-group.md) component is displayed as solid buttons. It's better to use these buttons if the question has 2-4 short answer options.

If there are more answer options, or they are long, it's better to use [field.radio-group](../reference/field.radio-group.md), as in the example.


## Compare the video with another type of data {#compare-video-and-other}

Add an image using the [view.image](../reference/view.image.md) component. Place the video next to the image using the [layout.columns](../reference/layout.columns.md) component.

Place the video next to the text or audio using the [view.list](../reference/view.list.md) component.

#### Compare the video with text

Add the [view.text](../reference/view.text.md) component.

#### Compare audio tracks

Add the [view.audio](../reference/view.audio.md) component.


## Compare the video with search results {#compare-results}

You can display a web page in an embedded window using the [view.iframe](../reference/view.iframe.md) component. Place the video next to it using [layout.side-by-side](../reference/layout.side-by-side.md).

In the example, the video is compared to the search results generated by the [helper.search-query](../reference/helper.search-query.md) component.


## Add clarifying questions to one of the options {#add-addition}

The [helper.switch](../reference/helper.switch.md) component displays an interface element after a specific response is selected. In this example, the user can only select correct statements about the video if it loaded.
