```python
OneCoinDawidSkene(
    self,
    n_iter: int = 100,
    tol: float = 1e-05
)
```

The **one-coin Dawid-Skene** aggregation model works exactly the same as the original Dawid-Skene model based on the EM algorithm, except for calculating the workers' errors


at the M-step of the algorithm.

For the one-coin model, a worker confusion (error) matrix is parameterized by a single parameter $s_w$:
$$
e^w_{j,z_j}  = \begin{cases}
    s_{w} & y^w_j = z_j \\
    \frac{1 - s_{w}}{K - 1} & y^w_j \neq z_j
\end{cases}
$$
where $e^w$ is a worker confusion (error) matrix of size $K \times K$ in case of the $K$ class classification,
$z_j$ be a true task label, $y^w_j$ is a worker
response to the task $j$, and $s_w$ is a worker skill (accuracy).

In other words, the worker $w$ uses a single coin flip to decide their assignment. No matter what the true label is, the worker has the $s_w$ probability to assign the correct label, and
has the $1 âˆ’ s_w$ probability to randomly assign an incorrect label. For the one-coin model, it
suffices to estimate $s_w$ for every worker $w$ and estimate $y^w_j$ for every task $j$. Because of its
simplicity, the one-coin model is easier to estimate and enjoys better convergence properties.

Parameters $p$, $e^w$, and latent variables $z$ are optimized with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm:
1. **E-step**. Estimates the true task label probabilities using the specified workers' responses,
the prior label probabilities, and the workers' error probability matrix.
2. **M-step**. Calculates a worker skill as their accuracy according to the label probability.
Then estimates the workers' error probability matrix by assigning user skills to error matrix row by row.

## Parameters Description

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| :----------| :----| :-----------|
`n_iter`|**int**|<p>The maximum number of EM iterations.</p>
`tol`|**float**|<p>The tolerance stopping criterion for iterative methods with a variable number of steps. The algorithm converges when the loss change is less than the `tol` parameter.</p>
`labels_`|**Optional\[Series\]**|<p>The task labels. The `pandas.Series` data is indexed by `task` so that `labels.loc[task]` is the most likely true label of tasks.</p>
`probas_`|**Optional\[DataFrame\]**|<p>The probability distributions of task labels. The `pandas.DataFrame` data is indexed by `task` so that `result.loc[task, label]` is the probability that the `task` true label is equal to `label`. Each probability is in the range from 0 to 1, all task probabilities must sum up to 1.</p>
`priors_`|**Optional\[Series\]**|<p>The prior label distribution. The `pandas.Series` data is indexed by `label` and contains the probability of the corresponding label occurrence. Each probability is in the range from 0 to 1, all probabilities must sum up to 1.</p>
`errors_`|**Optional\[DataFrame\]**|<p>The workers&#x27; error matrices. The `pandas.DataFrame` data is indexed by `worker` and `label` with a column for every `label_id` found in `data` so that `result.loc[worker, observed_label, true_label]` is the probability that `worker` produces `observed_label`, given that the task true label is `true_label`.</p>
`skills_`|**Optional\[Series\]**|<p>The workers&#x27; skills. The `pandas.Series` data is indexed by `worker` and has the corresponding worker skill.</p>
`loss_history_`|**List\[float\]**|<p>A list of loss values during training.</p>

**Examples:**


```python
from crowdkit.aggregation import OneCoinDawidSkene

df, gt = load_dataset('relevance-2')
hds = OneCoinDawidSkene(100)
result = hds.fit_predict(df)
