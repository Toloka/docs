Matrix Mean-Subsequence-Reduced Algorithm.


The M-MSR assumes that workers have different level of expertise and associated
with a vector of "skills" $\boldsymbol{s}$ which entries $s_i$ show the probability
of the worker $i$ to answer correctly to the given task. Having that, we can show that
$$
\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{M}{M-1}\widetilde{C}-\frac{1}{M-1}\boldsymbol{1}\boldsymbol{1}^T\right]
 = \boldsymbol{s}\boldsymbol{s}^T,
$$
where $M$ is the total number of classes, $\widetilde{C}$ is a covariation matrix between
workers, and $\boldsymbol{1}\boldsymbol{1}^T$ is the all-ones matrix which has the same
size as $\widetilde{C}$.


So, the problem of recovering the skills vector $\boldsymbol{s}$ becomes equivalent to the
rank-one matrix completion problem. The M-MSR algorithm is an iterative algorithm for *rubust*
rank-one matrix completion, so its result is an estimator of the vector $\boldsymbol{s}$.
Then, the aggregation is the weighted majority vote with weights equal to
$\log \frac{(M-1)s_i}{1-s_i}$.
